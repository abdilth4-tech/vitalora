## 🔍 PART 1: CURRENT RISK SCORING ANALYSIS

### 6 Disease Models Currently Implemented

| Model | Coverage | Evidence Base | Completeness |
|-------|----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Metabolic Syndrome** | BMI, Waist, Lipids, BP, Glucose, UA | IDF 2006 + NCEP ATP III | ✓ 85% |
| **Diabetes** | Age, BMI, FG, HbA1c, Family Hx, Lifestyle | FINDRISC + ADA 2024 | ✓ 80% |
| **Heart Disease** | Age, Gender, Lipids, BP, Smoking, Family Hx | Framingham simplified | ✓ 75% |
| **Hypertension** | BP categories, Lifestyle, Salt, Sleep, Stress | JNC-8 + WHO/ISH | ✓ 70% |
| **Stroke** | Age, HTN, Smoking, DM, Lipids, Family Hx | ASCVD framework | ✓ 65% |
| **Sleep Quality** | Duration, Quality (self), BMI, Smoking, Alcohol | PSQI adapted | ✓ 60% |

### 🚨 Critical Gaps in Risk Models

#### 1. **Metabolic Syndrome** — Missing Asian-Specific Criteria
- ❌ IDF cutoff for waist circumference is region-specific
- ❌ No NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) assessment — very common in Asia
- ❌ Uric acid included but not validated for MetS

**Fix Needed:** Add NAFLD risk (via ALT/AST), validate waist cutoffs for Indonesia/Asia

---

#### 2. **Diabetes** — Missing High-Risk Screening (Albuminuria)
- ❌ No albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) input
- ❌ No gestational diabetes history (for females)
- ❌ Missing PCOS screening (for females 18-40)

**Fix Needed:** Add ACR field, GDM history, PCOS screening

---

#### 3. **Heart Disease** — Missing Inflammatory Markers
- ❌ No high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) — strong independent predictor
- ❌ No lipoprotein(a) — genetic predisposition marker
- ❌ No family history of early MI (<55M, <65F)

**Fix Needed:** Add hsCRP, Lp(a), early MI family history

---

#### 4. **Hypertension** — Missing Kidney Function
- ❌ No serum creatinine / eGFR — crucial for HTN + diabetes risk stratification
- ❌ No albuminuria — marker of end-organ damage
- ❌ No home BP monitoring trend (only one-time lab value)

**Fix Needed:** Add kidney function (eGFR, ACR), BP monitoring history

---

#### 5. **Stroke** — Missing Atrial Fibrillation Screening
- ❌ No pulse irregularity check (easy bedside exam)
- ❌ No history of TIA/ministrokes
- ❌ Missing homocysteine (for high-risk patients)

**Fix Needed:** Add AF screening, TIA history, homocysteine optional

---

#### 6. **Sleep Quality** — Too Simplistic
- ❌ No OSA (obstructive sleep apnea) screening — affects HTN/DM risk 3x
- ❌ Missing shift work assessment
- ❌ No nightmare/anxiety component

**Fix Needed:** Add STOP-BANG OSA screening

---

#### 7. **General Missing Items:**
- ❌ **Kidney Disease Screening** — No eGFR (from creatinine), no ACR
- ❌ **Genetic Risk Intensity** — Family history is single YES/NO, should track: relation, age of onset, severity
- ❌ **Inflammatory Markers** — No hsCRP (CRP), no fibrinogen
- ❌ **Psychosocial** — No depression screening (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7)
- ❌ **Medication History** — No current medication list
- ❌ **Social Determinants** — No income, education, access to healthcare

---

## 🔬 PART 2: CONSENSUS API RESEARCH INTEGRATION PLAN

### Why Consensus API?

**Problem:** Features built without peer-reviewed evidence → may not reflect best practices → patient harm risk

**Solution:** Before implementing each feature, search Consensus API for:
1. Effectiveness of intervention
2. Target population evidence
3. Guidelines from major organizations (ADA, ESC, KDIGO)
4. Sample size & quality assessment

### Research Topics (Priority Order)

#### **CRITICAL — Implement First (Weeks 1-2)**

| Topic | Consensus Query | Use Case |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| **Metabolic Syndrome Prevention** | "Lifestyle intervention metabolic syndrome efficacy RCT" | Justify lifestyle module |
| **Diabetes Prevention** | "Diabetes prevention program lifestyle exercise efficacy" | DPP-style intervention |
| **Hypertension Management** | "Home blood pressure monitoring hypertension control" | BP tracking validation |
| **Albuminuria as Screening** | "Albumin-to-creatinine ratio diabetes risk prediction" | CKD screening |
| **Kidney Disease Staging** | "eGFR KDIGO CKD classification prevalence Asia" | CKD management |

#### **HIGH — Implement Weeks 2-3**

| Topic | Query | Use Case |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Sleep Apnea & HTN** | "Obstructive sleep apnea hypertension treatment CPAP RCT" | OSA screening |
| **Medication Adherence** | "Medication adherence intervention mobile app efficacy" | Adherence tracking |
| **Genetic Risk Counseling** | "Family history vs genetic testing cardiovascular risk prediction" | Family history module |
| **Inflammation & CVD** | "High-sensitivity CRP cardiovascular risk prediction independent" | hsCRP integration |
| **Mental Health & DM** | "Depression diabetes glycemic control bidirectional relationship" | Mental health screening |

#### **MEDIUM — Nice-to-have (Weeks 3-4)**

| Topic | Query | Use Case |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Exercise Prescription** | "Exercise intensity duration metabolic syndrome diabetes improvement" | Exercise module |
| **Dietary Intervention** | "Mediterranean diet DASH diet hypertension diabetes RCT" | Nutrition module |
| **Stress Management** | "Mindfulness meditation cardiovascular disease anxiety RCT" | Stress module |

## 🏥 PART 3: MEDICAL APPROPRIATENESS EVALUATION

### For Target Diseases: Metabolic Syndrome, Diabetes, Hypertension, CKD

#### **A. Metabolic Syndrome (Insulin Resistance Cluster)**

**Definition:** ≥3 of: Central obesity + High BP + High triglycerides + Low HDL + Impaired fasting glucose

**Vitalora Coverage:**

| Feature | Current | Gap |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **Screening & Diagnosis** | ✓ IDF criteria model | ❌ NAFLD assessment, UA levels not validated |
| **Patient Education** | ❌ Missing | ❌ NO content on what is metabolic syndrome |
| **Lifestyle Intervention** | ⚠️ Monitoring only | ❌ NO structured weight loss program (5-10% goal) |
| **Pharmacotherapy** | ❌ Missing | ❌ NO metformin monitoring, lipid drug tracking |
| **Follow-up** | ❌ Missing | ❌ NO 3-month reassessment schedule |
| **Comorbidity Management** | ⚠️ Partial (DM screening) | ❌ NO treatment for individual components |

**Recommendation:** **CRITICAL** — Implement Treatment Pathway for Metabolic Syndrome (Batch 16)

---

#### **B. Diabetes Mellitus (Type 2 Prevalence ~8% Indonesia)**

**Vitalora Coverage:**

| Feature | Current | Gap |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **Risk Prediction** | ✓ FINDRISC + ADA | ❌ Missing GDM history, PCOS screening, HbA1c target personalization |
| **Diagnosis** | ⚠️ Shows risk score | ❌ NO clear pathway when FG/HbA1c diagnostic criteria met |
| **Patient Education** | ❌ Missing | ❌ NO DM pathophysiology, complications education |
| **Lifestyle Program** | ⚠️ Monitoring only | ❌ NO structured DPP (Diabetes Prevention Program) replication |
| **Medication Tracking** | ❌ Missing | ❌ NO insulin/metformin/GLP1 adherence monitoring |
| **Lab Monitoring** | ✓ Glucose input | ❌ NO HbA1c trending, no kidney function (ACR/eGFR) |
| **Complication Screening** | ❌ Missing | ❌ **NO retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy assessment** |
| **Preventive Care** | ❌ Missing | ❌ NO annual foot exam, eye exam scheduling |

**Recommendation:** **CRITICAL** — Implement Diabetes Management Pathway (Batch 17)

---

#### **C. Hypertension (HTN) (Prevalence ~31% Indonesia)**

**Vitalora Coverage:**

| Feature | Current | Gap |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **Risk Stratification** | ⚠️ BP categories only | ❌ NO ABPM (24h), HOME BP trending, organ damage assessment |
| **Home BP Monitoring** | ❌ Missing | ❌ NO guided patient self-measurement protocol |
| **Lifestyle Intervention** | ⚠️ Salt, Exercise | ❌ NO DASH diet, weight loss targets, alcohol reduction |
| **Pharmacotherapy** | ❌ Missing | ❌ NO drug selection (ACEi vs ARB vs CCB), titration schedule |
| **Kidney Protection** | ❌ Missing | ❌ **CRITICAL: NO ACR/eGFR monitoring** for DM+HTN |
| **Follow-up** | ❌ Missing | ❌ NO 2-week BP check post-medication, NO 3-month reassessment |
| **Hypertensive Crisis** | ❌ Missing | ❌ NO when-to-seek-ER guidance |

**Recommendation:** **CRITICAL** — Implement Hypertension Management Pathway (Batch 18)

---

#### **D. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) (Prevalence ~3.8% Indonesia, often undiagnosed)**

**Current State in Vitalora:** ❌ **COMPLETELY ABSENT**

**What's Needed:**

| Feature | Gap |
|---------|-----|
| **Risk Factors** | ❌ NO screening for: HTN, DM, CKD family history, NSAIDs use |
| **Screening Test** | ❌ NO eGFR (from creatinine), NO ACR |
| **CKD Staging** | ❌ NO KDIGO stages (G1-G5 by eGFR, A1-A3 by ACR) |

**Recommendation:** **CRITICAL** — Implement CKD Screening & Management (NEW Batch 19)

---

#### **E. Albuminuria (Microalbumin) — Critical Screening Test**

**Current State:** ❌ **COMPLETELY ABSENT**

**Why It Matters:**
- Earliest sign of diabetic kidney disease (before creatinine rises)
- Predictive of cardiovascular disease (even without diabetes)
- Asian populations have high rates: 30% DM patients have albuminuria
- Reversible if caught early (ACEi/ARB, glycemic control)

**Vitalora Gap:**
- ❌ NO ACR (albumin-to-creatinine ratio) input field
- ❌ NO urine dipstick option
- ❌ NO interpretation: "Microalbuminuria stage 1" vs "Macroalbuminuria"
- ❌ NO triggered referral: "If ACR ≥300, refer to nephrologist"

**Recommendation:** **CRITICAL** — Add Albuminuria Screening Module (Part of Batch 19)

## 🎯 PART 4: TREATMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM — NEW ARCHITECTURE

### User Story

```
Patient A (35F) diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes by doctor.
Doctor creates a Treatment Plan:
  - Goal: HbA1c <7%, weight loss 5kg in 3 months
  - Medications: Metformin 500mg BID, SGLT2i daily
  - Lifestyle: 150min/week exercise, DASH diet, <5g salt/day
  - Monitoring: Home glucose tracking, weekly weight, monthly HbA1c

Every day, Patient sees:
  - ✓ Checklist: Did you exercise? (Planned: 30min walk)
  - ✓ Checklist: Did you take medications? (✓ AM metformin, ✓ PM SGLT2i)
  - ✓ Checklist: Did you stay on diet? (✓ No sugar, ✓ <2000 kcal)
  - ✓ Checklist: Did you log vitals? (⏳ Pending glucose)
  - 📊 Weekly progress: Weight down 0.5kg, glucose avg 145 mg/dL (target <140)
  - 📈 Doctor feedback: "Great! Keep going. Increase exercise to 200min if tolerated."

Every month:
  - Doctor reviews: HbA1c trend, medication adherence, weight loss, side effects
  - Doctor adjusts: "Add Pioglitazone if HbA1c still >7%"
  - Doctor sends: Updated checklist goals
```

### 🔴 BATCH 16: Albuminuria & CKD Screening Module

**Goal:** Add kidney function indicators to risk scoring

**Files to Create:**
1. Update `shared/risk-engine.js` — Add `kidneyScore()` function
2. Update `patient/health-profile.html` — Add kidney function section (Step 5A)
3. New `patient/kidney-info.html` — CKD education page

**Implementation Details:**

```javascript
// In risk-engine.js, add:
function kidneyScore(profile) {
  const factors = [];
  let score = 0;

  // eGFR (calculated from creatinine)
  const egfr = profile.eGFR || calculateEGFR(profile.creatinine, profile.age, profile.gender);
  if (egfr !== null) {
    if (egfr < 30) { score += 40; factors.push('CKD Stage 4 (eGFR ' + egfr + ' mL/min)'); }
    else if (egfr < 45) { score += 30; factors.push('CKD Stage 3b (eGFR ' + egfr + ')'); }
    else if (egfr < 60) { score += 20; factors.push('CKD Stage 3a (eGFR ' + egfr + ')'); }
    else if (egfr < 90) { score += 8; factors.push('eGFR borderline (eGFR ' + egfr + ')'); }
  }

  // ACR (albumin-to-creatinine ratio)
  const acr = profile.acrUrine; // mg/g
  if (acr !== null) {
    if (acr >= 300) { score += 25; factors.push('Macroalbuminuria (ACR ' + acr + ' mg/g)'); }
    else if (acr >= 30) { score += 15; factors.push('Microalbuminuria (ACR ' + acr + ' mg/g)'); }
  }

  // Cause of CKD
  if (profile.knownConditions?.diabetes) { score += 15; }
  if (profile.knownConditions?.hypertension) { score += 10; }
  if (profile.familyHistory?.kidneyDisease) { score += 12; }

  // NSAID use (risk factor)
  if (profile.nsaidFrequency === 'frequent') { score += 8; }

  if (factors.length === 0) factors.push('Fungsi ginjal dalam batas normal');
  return { score: clamp(score, 0, 100), category: RISK_CATEGORY(score), factors };
}

function calculateEGFR(creatinine, age, gender) {
  // MDRD formula (simplified)
  const isMale = gender !== 'female';
  const factor = isMale ? 1 : 0.742;
  return 186 * Math.pow(creatinine, -1.154) * Math.pow(age, -0.203) * factor;
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `patient/health-profile.html` — Add Step 5A: "Kidney Health"
  - Input: Serum creatinine (mg/dL)
  - Input: ACR (mg/g) or urine albumin (random or 24-hour)
  - Input: NSAID frequency (radio: never/rare/frequent)
  - Display: Calculated eGFR + KDIGO CKD stage

**Time:** 3 days (coding + testing)
