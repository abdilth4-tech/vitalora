```

#### 3. Scoring Algorithm
```javascript
## 🔢 SCORING ALGORITHM

### Input Variables:
- family_history: binary (yes=1, no=0)
- symptom_presence: binary (yes=1, no=0)
- risk_factors_count: 0-5
- BMI: numeric
- waist_circumference: numeric
- WHtR: numeric
- symptom_frequency: 0-10 (slider scale)
- symptom_impact: 0-10 (slider scale)

### Weights:
- Symptoms: 30%
- Risk Factors: 40%
- Anthropometric: 30%

### Calculation:

// Symptom Points (0-30)
symptom_points = (symptom_presence × 10) + (symptom_frequency × 1.5) + (symptom_impact × 1)
// Max: 10 + 15 + 10 = 35, but capped at 30

// Risk Factor Points (0-40)
risk_base = risk_factors_count × 5  // 0-25
family_history_pts = family_history × 10  // +10 if yes
risk_points = MIN(risk_base + family_history_pts, 40)

// Anthropometric Points (0-30)
BMI_pts = 0
if BMI >= 30: BMI_pts = 15  // Obese
else if BMI >= 25: BMI_pts = 10  // Overweight
else if BMI >= 23: BMI_pts = 5  // Asian threshold

waist_pts = 0
if waist > 102cm (male) or > 88cm (female): waist_pts = 10

WHtR_pts = 0
if WHtR > 0.6: WHtR_pts = 5

anthro_points = BMI_pts + waist_pts + WHtR_pts  // Capped at 30

// Final Score
FINAL_SCORE = (symptom_points × 0.30) + (risk_points × 0.40) + (anthro_points × 0.30)
// Scale to 0-100
FINAL_SCORE = (FINAL_SCORE / 100) × 100  // or normalize based on max possible

### Risk Categories:
- 0-30: LOW RISK
- 31-70: MODERATE RISK
- 71-100: HIGH RISK
```

#### 4. Medical Recommendations
```markdown
## 🏥 MEDICAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### LOW RISK (Score 0-30)
**Actions:**
- No immediate lab work needed
- Re-screen in 3-5 years (normal population screening)
- Focus: Lifestyle maintenance

**Referral:** None unless symptomatic

### MODERATE RISK (Score 31-70)
**Lab Work Required:**
- Lipid panel (Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, Triglycerides)
- Fasting glucose
- Blood pressure

**Referral Criteria:**
- If Non-HDL > 130 mg/dL → Consult cardiologist
- If multiple risk factors → Preventive cardiologist visit

**Timeline:** Within 4 weeks

### HIGH RISK (Score 71-100)
**Lab Work (URGENT):**
- Full lipid panel
- Fasting glucose
- Blood pressure
- EKG (electrocardiogram)

**Referral:** IMMEDIATE to cardiologist
**Note:** May require medication (statins) + lifestyle intervention

**Timeline:** Within 1-2 weeks
```

### PREPARATION & CONSUMPTION RULES

#### HERBAL TIMING CRITICAL RULES
- **Morning Dose:** 30-60 minutes AFTER breakfast
  - NOT before (empty stomach → nausea)
  - NOT with coffee/tea (reduces absorption)
  - Use: Plain hot water only (150-200ml)

- **Evening Dose:** 2-3 hours AFTER dinner (typically 19:00-20:00)
  - NOT right after eating (digestive interference)
  - NOT close to sleep (herbal warmth may disturb sleep)
  - Use: Plain hot water only

- **Mixing Rule:** NEVER mix herbal with:
  - Coffee, tea, milk, juice, alcohol
  - Other medications (wait 30 mins gap)
  - Food or meals

#### FOOD COMBINATION RULES TO AVOID
- **High Fat + High Fiber:** Can cause bloating
  - DON'T: Olive oil-heavy meal + high-fiber bread same meal
  - DO: Separate — olive oil with lunch, fiber with breakfast

- **Herbal + Dairy (within 2 hours):** Absorption interference
  - DON'T: Take herbal, then milk 1 hour later
  - DO: Space them out or take herbal with water only

- **Herbal + Coffee/Tea (within 1 hour):** Tannins block absorption
  - DON'T: Take herbal right after morning coffee
  - DO: Wait 1 hour minimum

#### HYDRATION PROTOCOL
- **Target:** 2-3 liters water daily
- **Timing:**
  - Morning: 1 glass upon waking (before breakfast)
  - Lunch: 1 glass 30 mins before meal
  - Afternoon: 1-2 glasses
  - Evening: Reduce intake after 19:00 (avoid nighttime urination)
- **Best Practice:** Drink 30 mins BEFORE & AFTER herbal dose
- **AVOID:** Sugary drinks, excess coffee (limit to 1-2 cups/day)

**Meal Flexibility:**
- Oatmeal can be replaced with: Bubur, lontong, or nasi kuning (whole grain option)
- Fish can be: Ikan goreng (but use healthier cooking oil), pepes ikan, or ikan bakar
- Brown rice: Mix with white rice if pure brown rice too expensive (still beneficial)
- Green tea: Can substitute with: Teh hijau lokal, atau herbal tradisional (tidak manis)

**Affordability Tips:**
- Buy fish: From local market (cheaper than supermarket)

- Vegetables: Seasonal, from pasar tradisional
- Almonds: Can substitute with: Kacang panjang, tempe (traditional protein)

**Social Eating:**
- Restaurant dining: Ask for grilled/baked (tidak digoreng)
- Family meals: Reduce portion of oil-heavy dishes, add extra vegetables
- Celebrations: Moderation — one special meal won't undo diet; return to plan next meal

### Task 2.2: Implement Scoring Algorithm
**Duration:** 1 hour
**File:** `www/patient/js/screening-dyslipidemia.js` (create if not exists)

**JavaScript Implementation:**
```javascript
// dyslipidemia.js

function calculateDyslipidemiascore(formData) {
  // Extract values
  const familyHistory = formData.family_history ? 1 : 0;
  const symptomPresence = formData.symptom_presence ? 1 : 0;
  const riskFactorsCount = formData.risk_factors.length;
  const BMI = calculateBMI(formData.weight, formData.height);
  const symptomFrequency = formData.symptom_frequency; // 0-10
  const symptomImpact = formData.symptom_impact; // 0-10

  // Calculate component scores
  const symptomPoints = Math.min(
    (symptomPresence * 10) + (symptomFrequency * 1.5) + (symptomImpact * 1),
    30
  );

  const riskBase = riskFactorsCount * 5;
  const familyHistoryPts = familyHistory * 10;
  const riskPoints = Math.min(riskBase + familyHistoryPts, 40);

  // Anthropometric points
  let BMIPts = 0;
  if (BMI >= 30) BMIPts = 15;
  else if (BMI >= 25) BMIPts = 10;
  else if (BMI >= 23) BMIPts = 5;

  let waistPts = 0;
  if ((formData.gender === 'M' && formData.waist > 102) ||
      (formData.gender === 'F' && formData.waist > 88)) {
    waistPts = 10;
  }

  const WHtRPts = (formData.waist / (formData.height * 100)) > 0.6 ? 5 : 0;

  const anthroPoints = Math.min(BMIPts + waistPts + WHtRPts, 30);

  // Final score
  const finalScore = (symptomPoints * 0.30) + (riskPoints * 0.40) + (anthroPoints * 0.30);

  // Determine risk category
  let riskCategory;
  if (finalScore <= 30) riskCategory = "low";
  else if (finalScore <= 70) riskCategory = "moderate";
  else riskCategory = "high";

  return {
    score: Math.round(finalScore),
    symptom_points: Math.round(symptomPoints),
    risk_points: Math.round(riskPoints),
    anthro_points: Math.round(anthroPoints),
    risk_category: riskCategory
  };
}

function calculateBMI(weight, height) {
  return weight / ((height / 100) ** 2);
}
```

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Score calculation produces 0-100 range
- [ ] Risk categories correct (Low ≤30, 31-70 Moderate, High ≥71)
- [ ] Formula matches spec exactly
- [ ] Test cases pass (sample inputs produce expected scores)

3. **Summary** (key findings from wizard)
4. **Medical Recommendations** (from spec based on risk category)
5. **Herbal Recommendation** (specific formula for their risk level)
6. **Dietary Pattern** (meal plan snippet)
7. **Action Buttons:**
   - "Save to Health Journal"
   - "Share with Doctor"
   - "Add Herbal to Cart"
   - "Set Reminder for Follow-up"
8. **Footer:** Links to disease-risk.html

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] All sections display based on risk category

2. Write saveToFirestore() function
3. Add timestamp & user ID
4. Store all form data
5. Store calculated score & recommendations
6. Add error handling & success confirmation

**Code:**
```javascript
async function saveToFirestore(score, formData) {
  const userId = VAuth.getCurrentUser().uid;

  const result = {
    timestamp: new Date(),
    disease: "dyslipidemia",
    wizard: formData,
    score: score,
    status: {
      viewed: true,
      saved_to_journal: false,
      shared_with_doctor: false
    }
  };

  try {
    const docRef = await VDB.addDocument(
      `screening_results/${userId}/dyslipidemia`,
      result
    );
    console.log("Result saved:", docRef.id);
    return docRef.id;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Save failed:", error);
    showToast("Gagal menyimpan hasil", "error");
  }
}
```

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Data saved to Firestore correctly

## 📞 FINAL NOTES FOR GEMINI CLI

- **If stuck on herbal recommendations:** Use established compounds (curcumin, milk thistle, garlic, hawthorn, St. John's Wort)
- **If stuck on meal plans:** Reference common Indonesian foods (nasi goreng alternatives, ikan goreng, tempe, etc.)
- **If Firestore structure unclear:** Follow the provided schema exactly
- **If scoring formula unclear:** Test with sample data (young healthy person should score low, elderly with risk factors should score high)
- **If time runs out:** Prioritize completing all 6 SPECS (Phase 1) over implementing features (Phase 2)

**MOST IMPORTANT:** Update this file regularly so next AI can see exactly where you left off!

**Status:** READY FOR GEMINI CLI TO START
**Start Date:** 2026-03-24
