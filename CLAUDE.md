## 6. QUALITY ASSESSMENT — GRADE METHODOLOGY

### GRADE Framework Application

Each study assessed on:
1. **Risk of Bias** (design quality, confounding control)
2. **Consistency** (homogeneity across studies)
3. **Directness** (relevance to target population/outcomes)
4. **Precision** (confidence intervals, sample size)
5. **Publication Bias** (funnel plot assessment)

### Evidence Quality Categories
- **Grade A (High Quality):** Further research unlikely to change effect estimate
  - Multiple RCTs, consistent results, large sample sizes
  - Example: INTERHEART Study (CVD risk factors, 12,461 cases)

- **Grade B (Moderate Quality):** Further research may change effect estimate
  - Well-designed cohort studies, some RCT evidence
  - Example: Framingham Heart Study (HTN complications, 44-year follow-up)

- **Grade C (Low Quality):** Further research very likely to change effect estimate
  - Observational studies only, small sample sizes, inconsistent results
  - Example: Single-center case series

- **Grade D (Very Low Quality):** Any evidence estimate uncertain
  - Expert opinion, mechanistic studies, case reports only
  - Example: Commentary or theoretical framework

### Quality Assessment Documentation
**File:** `SLR_GRADE_ASSESSMENT.xlsx`
**Columns per study:** RoB, Consistency, Directness, Precision, Publication Bias, Overall Grade

## 7. DATA SYNTHESIS & ANALYSIS

### Synthesis Approach
**Type:** Narrative synthesis with tabular summaries (no meta-analysis due to heterogeneity)

**By Disease:**
1. Pathophysiological pathway diagram (ASCII flowchart)
2. Risk factor cascade (with evidence strength ratings)
3. Biomarker summary table (sensitivity, specificity, AUROC by study)
4. Risk stratification algorithms (0-100 score formulas)
5. Key clinical cutoff points (with supporting papers)
6. GRADE evidence quality summary per outcome

### Thematic Analysis
- **Biomarker Clustering:** Which biomarkers appear in >50% of studies (core markers)
- **Risk Factor Patterns:** Modifiable vs. genetic, prevalence of each factor
- **Gap Identification:** Missing evidence, unexplored combinations, population gaps
- **Intervention Evidence:** Strength of evidence for herbal/dietary modifications

### Output Documents
- `SLR_SYNTHESIS_REPORT.md` — Detailed synthesis by disease
- `SLR_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` — Research gaps and future directions
- `SLR_PATHOPHYSIOLOGY_DIAGRAMS.md` — Visual flowcharts with paper citations

## 8. RISK OF BIAS & QUALITY CONTROL

### Bias Mitigation Strategies
- ✅ **Selection Bias:** Comprehensive search across multiple databases, no language restriction in inclusion (English articles available)
- ✅ **Detection Bias:** Standardized data extraction form, dual extraction for 10% sample
- ✅ **Reporting Bias:** Search for published protocols, examine for outcome reporting bias
- ✅ **Publication Bias:** Citation tracking of landmark papers, gray literature supplementary search

### Verification Checkpoints
1. **Paper Authenticity** — Verify DOI exists, journal real, author credentials
2. **Data Accuracy** — Cross-check extracted numbers against original paper
3. **Citation Verification** — Confirm all landmark papers actually cited correctly
4. **Algorithm Validation** — Test risk scoring formulas against reported sensitivity/specificity

## 10. DISCUSSION (In Progress)

### Key Findings Summary
- **1,020+ papers** identified across 15 metabolic diseases
- **15 landmark papers** selected for deep analysis (GRADE A-B quality)
- **5 diseases prioritized** for evidence integration (dyslipidemia, hypertension, NAFLD, metabolic syndrome, diabetes)
- **Consistent pathophysiology patterns** identified across diseases (insulin resistance as common driver)
- **Evidence gaps identified** (see Section 11)

### Interpretation Against Background
- Current screening methodology still relies on individual biomarkers despite evidence for multi-factor algorithms
- GRADE A evidence exists for major risk factors but limited for integrated risk prediction in asymptomatic populations
- Herbal/dietary interventions underrepresented in high-quality trial evidence

---

## 11. LIMITATIONS & RESEARCH GAPS

### Limitations of This SLR
1. **Retrospective Design** — Not pre-registered; search strategy refined post-hoc
2. **Limited to 5 Diseases** — Only dyslipidemia, hypertension, NAFLD, MetS, diabetes fully synthesized (other 10 pending)
3. **English-Only Search** — Non-English publications potentially missed (translation technology not used)
4. **No Quantitative Meta-Analysis** — Heterogeneity precluded pooling (narratively synthesized instead)
5. **Gray Literature** — Guidelines from professional organizations included; industry-funded studies not separately flagged
6. **Citation Verification** — DOI links verified; full-text review of all 1,020 papers not completed

### Research Gaps Identified
1. **Integrated Risk Prediction** — Few studies combine multiple biomarkers into prospective risk algorithms for asymptomatic screening
2. **Herbal Medicine Evidence** — High-quality RCTs needed for traditional remedies (current evidence mostly observational)
3. **Precision Medicine** — Limited evidence for genetic/ethnic stratification of screening cutoffs
4. **Digital Health Integration** — Wearable sensors for continuous monitoring not yet validated for screening
5. **Real-World Implementation** — Limited evidence on barriers to screening adoption in low-resource settings
