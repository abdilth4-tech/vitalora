### Quality Assessment Tool (ROBIS — Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews)

For screening studies, use ROBIS Phase 1-3:

**Phase 1 — Specification:**
- Clear review question (✓ for each disease)
- Defined PICOS (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes, Study designs)
- Protocol availability (✓ documented here)

**Phase 2 — Identification of concern with review process:**
1. **Studies Identification** — Search comprehensiveness (✓ 9+ queries per disease)
2. **Study Selection** — Bias in selection (✓ dual screening, N≥100 only)
3. **Data Extraction** — Extraction bias (✓ standardized form)
4. **Study Appraisal** — Quality assessment tool (✓ ROBIS + QUADAS-2 for diagnostic)
5. **Synthesis & Findings** — Bias in synthesis (✓ narrative synthesis, no selective reporting)

**Phase 3 — Risk of bias judgment:**
- **LOW RISK**: Well-designed, comprehensive search, no major limitations
- **HIGH RISK**: Narrow search, selective reporting, poor quality appraisal
- **UNCLEAR**: Insufficient information to judge

#### Paper Quality Criteria (Modified QUADAS-2 for diagnostic studies):
```
Per Paper Score (1-5 stars):
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent:
  - RCT or prospective cohort, N > 500
  - Clear diagnostic criteria & validation
  - Follow-up >12 months for outcome confirmation
  - Sensitivity >80%, Specificity >85%
  - Multiple centers or diverse population

⭐⭐⭐⭐ Good:
  - RCT or cohort, N 200-500
  - Clear methodology
  - Follow-up 6-12 months
  - Sensitivity 70-80%, Specificity 75-85%

⭐⭐⭐ Fair:
  - Cross-sectional, N 100-200
  - Reasonable methodology
  - Sensitivity 60-70%, Specificity 65-75%
  - Single center

⭐⭐ Poor:
  - Small sample, poor design
  - Sensitivity <60% or Specificity <65%

⭐ Very Poor:
  - Conflicting results, very small N
  - Not suitable for meta-analysis

## 🧬 3. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS APPROACH

### For Each Disease:

**Step A — Evidence Table**
```
| Study | Year | N | Tool | Sens | Spec | AUC | Relevant | Notes |
|-------|------|---|------|------|------|-----|----------|-------|
```

**Step B — Forest Plot / Summary Statistics**
```
Tool performance across studies:
- Sensitivity: Mean ± SD, Range
- Specificity: Mean ± SD, Range
- AUC: Mean ± SD, Range (if available)
- Clinical utility: Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV)
```

**Step C — Meta-Analysis (if ≥3 comparable studies)**
- Use random-effects model (DerSimonian & Laird)
- Heterogeneity: I² test
- Publication bias: Egger's test

**Step D — Narrative Summary**
- Agreement/disagreement across studies
- Subgroup analysis (age, gender, region)
- Evidence grade (GRADE approach):
  - **A (High)**: RCT data, consistent, N > 1000, AUC > 0.80
  - **B (Moderate)**: Mixed RCT/cohort, some inconsistency, N 500-1000, AUC 0.70-0.80
  - **C (Low)**: Mostly observational, inconsistent, N < 500, AUC < 0.70
  - **D (Very Low)**: Expert opinion, case reports
