Open Access Rate:          100% ✅
LMIC/Indonesia Relevance:  ✅ (7+ papers Indonesia-specific)
Quality Level:             ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4 = average, 5 = RCT/multicenter)
```

### Implementation Scope

Risk Level:                LOW (modular, documented, tested)
```

### Health Impact (Projected)
```
CKD Detection:             ≥80% of eGFR <60 patients
HTN Control:               ≥60% achieve SBP <130
Medication Adherence:      ≥70% average
DM Complication Screening: 100% annual checklist
MetS Diagnosis Rate:       ≥60% of obese patients
```

## 🚀 EXECUTION PATH (Choose One)

### Option A: Sequential Approval (Recommended)
```
Day 1:  User reviews + approves Phase 1 (bugs)
        → I execute bugs (3-4 hours) + report
Day 2:  User reviews results + approves Phase 2 (batches 16-18)
        → I execute (11 days in parallel)
...continue weekly approval cycles...
```

### Option B: Full Approval Upfront (Faster)
```
Day 1:  User reviews ALL docs + gives full approval
        → I execute all phases autonomously
        → Weekly check-ins only
```

### Option C: Hybrid (Balance)
```
Day 1:  Approve Phases 1-2 (bugs + CKD) = no questions
Day 8:  Review results + approve Phases 3-4 (HTN + treatment)
        → Allows for adjustments if needed
```

## 💬 FAQ ABOUT THESE DOCUMENTS

**Q: Which document should I start with?**
A: QUICK_SUMMARY.md (5 min), then FINAL_EXECUTION_SUMMARY.md (20 min).

**Q: Are all documents necessary to read?**
A: No. Read FINAL_EXECUTION_SUMMARY for approval. Reference others as needed.

**Q: Can you start without my approval?**
A: No, per your explicit request: "tolong jangan lakukan perbaikan dulu, lakukan perencanaan saja dulu" (2026-03-24). Planning complete, now waiting for your "go".

**Q: What if I want to change the timeline?**
A: Feasible. Fastest path: 3-4 weeks (compress phases). Slowest: 2-3 months (add polish per batch). Decision needed per FINAL_EXECUTION_SUMMARY.md approval checklist.

**Q: What if I only want some batches?**
A: Module design allows priority: Tier 1 (CKD+HTN+DM) = critical; Tier 2 (MetS+treatment) = high; Tier 3 (evidence) = supporting. Can do Tier 1 only if needed.

**Q: How do I know batches are working?**
A: MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md has "Success Criteria" for each batch. I'll test per those criteria before moving to next batch.
