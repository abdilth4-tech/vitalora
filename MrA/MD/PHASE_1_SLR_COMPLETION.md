## 🔗 INTEGRATION POINTS

### Current: App Ready Now
All 5 research pages are **immediately deployable**:
- Standalone HTML pages (can be viewed independently)
- Use Vitalora design system (neumorphic cards, color-coded per disease)
- Mobile-responsive layout
- All links back to disease-risk.html

### To Integrate:
1. **Add links in disease-risk.html**:
   ```html
   <!-- For each disease card -->
   <a href="research-[disease].html" class="info-link">
     <ion-icon name="beaker-outline"></ion-icon> Lihat Penelitian
   </a>
   ```

2. **Optional: Create Research Hub page**:
   ```
   research-hub.html
   ├─ Overview (all 5 diseases)
   ├─ Evidence grade filter
   ├─ Search by keyword
   ├─ Download full SLR PDF report
   └─ Links to individual pages
   ```

3. **Add research badges to screening intro**:
   ```
   "Screening ini didukung oleh 180+ papers PRISMA-2020"
   "Evidence Grade: B (Moderate)"
   ```
