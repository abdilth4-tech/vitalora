## 🌿 HERBAL RECOMMENDATIONS STRUCTURE

**Reference:** PHASE_2_SLR_PROGRESS.md mentions herbal formulas in context of each disease.

**Template for Each Disease:**

```markdown
## 🌿 HERBAL RECOMMENDATIONS (Risk-Based)

### LOW RISK (Preventive)
Herbal Formula: "[Jamu Formula Name]"
├─ Main herbs: [list with amounts]
├─ Evidence: X papers backing (effect size %)
├─ Mechanism: [how it works]
├─ Dosage: [frequency & amount]
├─ Duration: [minimum treatment period]
├─ Expected Result: [measurable outcomes]
└─ Safety: [interactions, contraindications]

### MODERATE RISK (Therapeutic)
[Similar structure, higher potency]

### HIGH RISK (Intensive + Medical)
⚠️ ADJUNCTIVE to medical therapy (not replacement!)
[Similar structure, requires doctor approval]
```

**Where to Find Herbal Data:**
- Some papers mention traditional remedies (in research notes)
- BATCH 13 OCR Vademekum has Indonesian herbal database (if accessible)
- Otherwise: Use established herbal databases (curcumin for dyslipidemia, milk thistle for liver, etc.)

## 📊 SCORING ALGORITHM TEMPLATE

**Universal formula (adjust weights per disease):**

```javascript
Score = (Symptom_Points × weight1) + (Risk_Factor_Points × weight2) + (Lab_Proxy_Points × weight3)

Risk Categories:
├─ 0-30: LOW RISK
│  └─ → Preventive herbal + lifestyle counseling
├─ 31-70: MODERATE RISK
│  └─ → Therapeutic herbal + dietary intervention + lab work
└─ 71-100: HIGH RISK
   └─ → Medical referral + herbal adjunctive + intensive diet plan
```

## 🔗 NEXT STEPS AFTER SPECS ARE DONE

Once all 6 batch specs are completed:

1. **Implementation:** Another AI session will use these specs to build actual screening features
2. **Testing:** Create test cases for each scoring algorithm
3. **Integration:** Add to disease-risk.html with links
4. **Database:** Set up Firestore collections for results storage
5. **Deployment:** Deploy to staging environment for testing

## 📞 HANDOFF NOTES

**What went well:**
- Phase 2 SLR completed ahead of schedule
- All 15 research pages created with comprehensive evidence backing
- Clear specification template established
- Color scheme & design system documented

**Potential challenges:**
- Herbal recommendations need cultural validation (Indonesian context)
- Consumption patterns should reflect local food availability
- Scoring algorithms need validation with real patient data (future)
- Firestore integration requires careful data modeling

**Assumptions made:**
- User has access to herbal/Vademekum OCR data from Batch 13
- Meal plans should be Indonesian-friendly (nasi goreng, etc. alternatives)
- Medical thresholds based on international standards (may need localization)
- Budget ~6 hours per batch for specs (may vary)

---

**Status:** Ready for Gemini CLI to start **BATCH 17 specification creation**.
**Git branch:** main
**Last commit:** 5b36116

Good luck! 🚀
